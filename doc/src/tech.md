# Technical Documentation

This chapter of the book is for any general technical documentation relevant to
the game, that is not covered by the API docs.

Please use doc comments in the source code as much as possible instead, for anything
that should "live with the source code". It is much easier to keep docs updated, if
they are kept alongside the code.

However, there are things that might not be suitable to document in the source code,
such as overall architectural decisions, or anything that might also be useful to
non-programmers. That is what this chapter is for. :)
