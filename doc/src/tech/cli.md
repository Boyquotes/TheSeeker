# Dev Console

The Dev Console is a very handy and important thing to use during game
development. It is expected that everyone in the project is familiar with it.
It allows you to mess around with things in-game, which is very important for
testing out different functionality, incl. stuff that is not yet available via
the normal gameplay or UI.

## How to use

To bring up the console, press the `` ` `` or `~` key.

This will bring up an on-screen prompt, where you can type your command.

Command history (using up-arrow to bring up previous commands) is supported.

## Available commands

We document all commands [on this page](./cli-ref.md).

If you want to know what commands are available in your build of the game,
you can use the [`help`](./cli-ref.md#help) command to list them.

[See here for how to create your own commands.](./cli-howto.md)
