# Target Audience

This game combines various features and mechanics of:
- metroidvanias (i.e Hollow Knight)
- action RPGs (i.e Diablo)
- Sandbox Adventure Games (i.e Red Dead Redemption)

The fans of these genres are then naturally the audiences we're targetting.
This game is meant to give you the sense of mystery and non-linear exploration known from Metriodvanias, 
combined with the deep character build customization and intense combat known from action RPGs, 
while also allowing the player to (for the most part) define their own path and goals while inhabiting a mostly 'natural' and un-scripted world, like in Sandbox Adventures.
